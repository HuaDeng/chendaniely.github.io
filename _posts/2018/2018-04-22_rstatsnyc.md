Another year and another talk at the [NYC R Conference](https://www.rstats.nyc/).
As always,
the conference was filled with excellent speakers (I'm biased here becuase I was one of them...),
food, and people.

Brooke Watson ([@brookLYNevery1](https://twitter.com/brookLYNevery1)) did a *fantastic* job
illustrating and summarzing *all* of the talks.
So I've just linked to all her tweets (after the break).

Oh... and I got my books signed :)
