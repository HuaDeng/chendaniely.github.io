<h1>My Story</h1>

<h2>Early</h2>
I've always been surrounded by computers.
My parents both studied Computer Science,
and my dad holds a Master's in Computer Science and works as a software developer.
Growing up, all my computers were company hand-me-downs,
but it allowed me to be lucky enough to always have a computer in the house.
I liked to tinker, not as a programmer, or hacker, but more of a user.
As a child, one of the first things I'd do when I open a program would to find the preferences tab of a program,
and learn what settings were available, and learn how to use a piece of software.

I competed in the ThinkQuest Internet Challenge in the 5th grade,
and co-authored an award winning website on Epilepsy.

<h2>High School</h2>
I was fortunate to attend Stuyvesant High School, a specialized math and science high school in NYC.
One semester of programming was a mandatory for all sophomores.
Looking back, I'm amazed the amount of material covered in a semester of school:
Netlogo (where I co-wrote a BlackJack game),
Scheme (where I wrote a visual calculator that worked with negative values, e.g., xx - xxx = -x),
and Python (where I wrote a strategy for Prisoner's Dilemma).

<h2>College</h2>

<h2>Masters</h2>
I got my Master's in Public Health because of the clinical research skills it would give me.
It allowed me to build on the basic statistics knowledge I had from college,
and learn the epidemiology and biostatistics skills for clinical and observational study design and regression analysis.
I was lucky to be in the Department of Epidemiology when Sandro Galea was Chair of the department.
Under his guide, the department had a big push to study complex systems approaches to public health.
Here I got to work with Kerry Keyes, Magna Certa, and Melissa Tracy in a R01 studying ______.
I also met Mark Orr who became my Master's Thesis Advisor on "_____".

I learned to love teaching when I was a Quantative ____ Teaching Assistant for Dana March.
This let me to join Software Carpentry when I after a workshop led by Justin Ely and David Wade Farley.

I attended a Software Carpentry workshop when I took Introduction to Data Science during my Masters.
The course was taught by Rachael Shutt, Kayur Patel, and Jared Lander.
I learned R, and it changed my life.
What started out as a Master's in Public Health to gain clinical research skills before going to medical school
quickly evolved into Data Science where data analytics _________
