Interested in integrating hospital data in order to perform predictive health analytics and
building clinical support tools for clinicians through meaningful use.  Currently looking
at inter- and intra- hospital networks and comparing care coordination networks to improve
patient outcomes.  I am particularly interested in how patients move between medical care
providers and improving communication and patient care between multi-disciplinary care coordination teams.
